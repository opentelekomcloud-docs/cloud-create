  **v2.18 released:** Launch a fully operational Cloud Container Engine cluster with everything you need, right out of the box. Read more: the :ref:`cce`.

1. Overview
===========

Cloud Create is a **free-to-use** Cloud Management Platform that lets you build and deploy apps in minutes using **premade templates**.

Whether you're working on **Open Telekom Cloud** or **Swiss Open Telekom Cloud**, Cloud Create empowers you to go from idea to running infrastructure with speed and simplicity.

2. From Idea to Cloud in Just Four Steps
========================================

Cloud Create makes cloud-native development simple, fast, and collaborative. Whether you're deploying your apps on OpenShift or a Cloud Container Engine (CCE), you can go from ideas to cloud in minutes:

**1. Start with a premade template**

Choose from premade templates like :ref:`OpenShift`, :ref:`cce`, or :ref:`argocd` - no setup headaches, just ready-to-go blueprints.

**2. Visually design and customize**

Use the drag-and-drop visual designer to tailor infrastructure, software components, and automation to your exact needs - without writing complex YAML or Terraform.

**3. Deploy and update**

Launch your app with a single click. Need to make changes later? Redeploy updates just as easily, directly from the visual interface.

**4. Save and share your work**

Turn your customized app into a private template for your team, or publish it publicly on Open Telekom Cloud so others can benefit from your expertise.

2.1. Visual Cloud Development Made Effortless
---------------------------------------------

With Cloud Create, building and deploying cloud-native apps is as easy as drag, drop, and click. Use our intuitive **visual designer** to architect your full-stack application - starting from **premade templates** or building from scratch:

  :width: 800

  Figure 3. First select a premade template to start

After selecting a premade template, you have the flexibility to **quickly deploy** apps right away - or use them as a starting point to **visually design and customize** your cloud architecture.

  :width: 800

  Figure 4. Quick deploy or design using the template

In the design, you can seamlessly combine **infrastructure components** like compute, networking, storage, CCE, and powerful tools like **Bash**, **Ansible**, **Helm**, **Argo CD**, etc.:

2.2. Simplified System Administration
-------------------------------------

When your design is ready, simply hit “Deploy” - and Cloud Create will provision everything for you on Open Telekom Cloud in just minutes. Deploying apps with Cloud Create is simple, controlled, and fully transparent:

**1. Select, Configure, and Launch**

In the **Deploy** section, administrators choose the desired **application version**, fill in required **inputs**, and select a **cloud provider** - like Open Telekom Cloud. Before launching, they can easily **review the deployment workflow** to ensure everything is ready.

**2. Interactive, Step-by-Step Execution**

During deployment, administrators can **follow each step in real time**. Click on any stages to see exactly what's happening - **Terraform** automates infrastructure provisioning, while **Ansible** configures services on the target compute.

2.3. Extend What’s Possible with Custom TOSCA Services
------------------------------------------------------

With Cloud Create, you're not limited to what's out of the box. Cloud engineers can define new services using the open TOSCA format and seamlessly import them into the visual designer.

Whether it's a custom VM setup, a specialized software stack, or a reusable infrastructure pattern - define it once in TOSCA, then drag-and-drop it like any built-in components.

.. note::
   * Read more about :ref:`How to define and import a new service`.
   * Our premade templates and service catalogs are `opensource and available on our Github <https://github.com/opentelekomcloud-blueprints/tosca-service-catalogs>`_.

3. FAQ
======

3.1. How can I login in to Cloud Create
---------------------------------------

You can log in to Cloud Create using an **IAM user account** with the **Tenant Administrator** role. This is the the user account created in the Identity Management of the Web console. If you do not have an IAM user account, see Section :ref:`How to create an IAM user account`.

.. attention::

  If you have an **ICU account** or you login from **Telekom MMS IdP via an SSO**, you can first login to the Web console and then create a new IAM user account in the Web console. With the IAM user account, you can login to Cloud Create.

3.2. Which components are supported
-----------------------------------

An overview of all supported components is available in Section :ref:`Components overview`.

3.3. Is Cloud Create opensource
-------------------------------

Cloud Create is based on two opensource projects Application Lifecycle Enablement for Cloud (Alien4cloud) and Ystia Orchestrator (Yorc). At Open Telekom Cloud, we further integrate it with OpenStack and Google Cloud, provide an easy-to-use UI, added features (e.g., secrets management, deployment update, the :ref:`openshift`, etc.), and enforce the strictest Privacy and Security Assessment (PSA) process of Deutsche Telekom.

All premade templates and service components are opensource and available on `our Github <https://github.com/opentelekomcloud-blueprints/tosca-service-catalogs>`_.

3.4. Which Terraform version do you use
---------------------------------------

We use Terraform 1.5.4 under the Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0).

3.5. Which Ansible version do you support
-----------------------------------------

We currently support Ansible :code:`10.5.0` (i.e., Ansible core :code:`2.17.4`), which is compatible with `target VM having Python 3.7 - 3.12 <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html>`_ installed. The following table shows the compatibility matrix with Operating Systems:

+-----------------------------+----------------+-------------------------------------+
